# Virtual Catalog

In this README I'll talk about my school project and what would need to install if necessary.

The project was made during my internship, in which it was adapted to be my final course project for the Professional Aptitude Test (PAP). 
The aim was to create a digital catalog that will list products and allow to add them to a shopping cart. The main feature of the application is to compare the differents decorations for the list of products in the cart.
